Changes between BOINC 6.2 and Synecdoche 0.1.1:

[General]

 * Tons of code cleanup, including removal of many fixed-size buffers in favor
   of std::string.

 * Existing code documentation converted to Doxygen, and some more added.

 * All server code was removed from the repository. The application API is not
   maintained, and will be also removed eventually.

 * Workarounds and special code for Win9x was removed. BOINC recently removed it
   too (in 6.8).

 * All special code for OS/2 was removed.

 * The Windows installer was removed. We may make a new one eventually.

 * There is a new Mac installer using Iceberg.

 * The Unix build system was improved. 'make dist' now produces a usable
   tarball, 'make install' works with staging (it used to try installing things
   into /etc no matter what).

 * The Mac Xcode project has been cleaned up significantly internally.


[GUI]

 * Separated suspend/resume and allow new tasks / no more tasks buttons. This
   allows users to use these operations on multiple selections.

 * In the attach project wizard, the list of projects is now sorted by name,
   instead of using random order. BOINC recently changed this too (6.8?).

 * When aborting multiple tasks at once, the confirmation dialog now lets you
   say "Yes to all", instead of having to click "Yes" for every aborted task.

 * Removed the accessible view. It was essentially the same as the advanced
   view.


[Core client]

 * The --attach_project, --detach_project, etc. switches from the core client
   were removed. They are supposed to be for debugging, but they confuse users
   who think that's the correct way to attach new projects.

 * Removed misfeature that silently enables network activity if a user does
   something that needs the network, like updating a project.

 * A strict verification of input files is done before starting tasks.
   NOTE: this causes problems with POEM@Home, because of a bug on *their* side.

 * Don't try to get new version notifications or updated project list from BOINC
   server.

 * Unix: don't use current working directory as data directory. Instead,
   hardcode the correct path into the binary at compile time. It can be changed
   by running the client with --dir. This avoids problems if users start the
   client by hand, from "wrong" places. In the future, syneccmd and synecmgr
   will do the same.

 * In BOINC, if a GUI RPC client fails to authenticate, the connection is
   dropped. This is to avoid a possible denial of service vulnerability, but
   doesn't solve the underlying problem. We removed that 'fix', and instead
   avoid the denial of service by only writing to the socket if the socket is
   actually ready to write, and queue data otherwise.
