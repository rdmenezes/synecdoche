Quick start
===========

As in most packages available nowadays, compiling and installing Synecdoche is
done by running the usual 'configure' and 'make' commands:

$ ./configure --prefix=<PREFIX>
$ make
$ make install

Replace <PREFIX> with the filesystem path where Synecdoche should be installed.
The default is /usr/local, in which case you will have to run 'make install' as
root.

If you got Synecdoche from SVN (instead of a release tarball), or if for some
other reason you don't have Synecdoche's 'configure' script, you will need
to run "autoreconf -i" before configure.


Requirements
============

To build Synecdoche on a Unix platform, you need a relatively modern C++
compiler, and the following libraries:

 * libcurl 7.17.1 or later (SSL support may be required for some projects)
 * OpenSSL 0.9.8 or later
 * wxWidgets 2.6 or later, for the graphical manager (optional)

To run autoreconf, you need autoconf 2.58+ and automake 1.08+ installed.


Running
=======

To start the client, run 'synecd' (in <PREFIX>/bin).
<PREFIX>/var/synecdoche/ will be used as the data directory automatically.

To run the graphical manager, you must run <PREFIX>/bin/synecmgr from the data
directory (ie. with <PREFIX>/var/synecdoche/ as the current directory), or it
won't be able to connect to the client.
