= Building the client on Windows =

You will need:

 * Visual C++ 2005
 * A Subversion client
 * wxWidgets 2.8 for the GUI
 * WiX 3.0 for the installer

== Get the code ==

 # Checkout the branch you want to build.
 # Checkout svn/synecdoche_depends_win_vs2005/

== Environment ==

|| *Variable*    || *Path* ||
|| WXWIN         || The folder containing wxWidgets ||
|| SYNEC_DEPENDS || The folder containing synecdoche_depends_win_vs2005 ||

Ensure that PATH includes the Subversion client, WiX, and the Platform SDK (usually the installers will take care of this).

== Building ==
First, build the debug and release configurations for wxWidgets.

Finally, build the Synecdoche solution.

== Other versions of Visual Studio ==
If you are building against anything other than Visual C++ Runtime 8.0.50727.762 then you will have to rebuild all the dependencies and change the merge module. The version in SVN will always reflect the official build environment.
