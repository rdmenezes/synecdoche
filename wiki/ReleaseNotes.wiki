#summary Release notes for Synecdoche version 0.1.1

= Introduction =

The release notes for Synecdoche document differences from BOINC,
and things you will want to watch out for when running Synecdoche.

= Notes for 0.1.1 =

Synecdoche is based on BOINC 6.2.
This means there is no support for running CUDA applications,
since it was added in BOINC 6.4.
We have no plans to implement CUDA support in the near future.

== Differences from BOINC ==
 * Some UI updates

== Limitations ==

=== All Platforms ===
 * Cannot be running at the same time as BOINC.
 * Some projects may not work correctly due to improved checks. A [ProjectCompatibilityMatrix project compatibility list] is kept to document incompatibilities. Currently the only project known to have problems is POEM@Home.

=== Windows ===

=== Mac OS X ===
There is currently no uninstaller.
Dragging the application to the Trash does not fully remove Synecdoche,
the project data and the screensaver will remain in the system.
This will be addressed in a future version.

Unicode support seems sketchy at best.

=== Linux ===
