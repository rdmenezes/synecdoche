#summary Release notes for Synecdoche version 0.1.1

= Introduction =

The release notes for Synecdoche document differences from BOINC,
and things you will want to watch out for when running Synecdoche.

= Notes for 0.1.1 =

Synecdoche is based on BOINC 6.2.
This means there is no support for running CUDA applications,
since it was added in BOINC 6.4.
We have no plans to implement CUDA support in the near future.

== Differences from BOINC ==
 * Some UI updates

== Limitations ==

Synecdoche cannot be running at the same time as BOINC.
This is not a bug; it would be the same as running two instances of BOINC at the same time.

Some projects may not work correctly.
We try to remain compatible with BOINC,
but sometimes projects rely on more implementation details than they should.
A [ProjectCompatibilityMatrix project compatibility list] is kept to document incompatibilities.
Currently the only project known to have problems is POEM@Home.


=== Windows ===

=== Mac OS X ===
There is currently no uninstaller.
Dragging the application to the Trash does not fully remove Synecdoche,
the project data and the screensaver will remain in the system.
This will be addressed in a future version.

Unicode support seems sketchy at best.

=== Linux ===
