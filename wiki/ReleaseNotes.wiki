#summary Release notes for Synecdoche version 0.1.1

= Introduction =

The release notes for Synecdoche document differences from BOINC,
and things you will want to watch out for when running Synecdoche.

= Notes for 0.1.1 =

== Differences from BOINC 6.2.x ==
 * Some UI updates

== Limitations ==

=== All Platforms ===
 * No CUDA support yet.
 * Cannot be running at the same time as BOINC.
 * Some projects may not work correctly due to improved checks. A [ProjectCompatibilityMatrix project compatibility list] is kept to document incompatibilities. Currently the only project known to have problems is POEM@Home.

=== Windows ===

=== Mac OS X ===
 * No uninstaller, and dragging the application to the Trash does not fully remove Synecdoche.
 * Unicode support seems sketchy at best.

=== Linux ===
