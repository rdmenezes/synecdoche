#summary Release notes for Synecdoche version 0.1.1
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

The release notes for Synecdoche document differences from BOINC,
and things you will want to watch out for when running Synecdoche.

= Notes for 0.1.1 =

Synecdoche is based on BOINC 6.2.
This means there is no support for running GPU applications,
since it was added in BOINC 6.4.
We have no plans to implement CUDA or ATI Stream support in the near future.

== Differences from BOINC ==
 * Performance and security updates
 * Separated suspend/resume and allow new tasks / no more tasks buttons. This allows using these operations on multiple selections.
 * In the attach project wizard, the list of projects is sorted by name.
 * When aborting multiple tasks at once, the confirmation dialog now has a "Yes to all" button, instead of having to click "Yes" for every aborted task.
 * Some usability fixes.

== Platform notes ==
__(see also InstallInstructions)__

=== Windows ===
There is no real installer yet.
Synecdoche is available as a zip archive
containing the needed programs.
For this reason,
there is no sandboxing,
service install,
or starting on boot.

Windows 95/98/ME are *not* supported.
Internally, they are like a different operating system
compared to NT/2000/XP/Vista.

=== Mac OS X ===
Synecdoche requires Mac OS X 10.4 or later.
It will run on a PowerPC machine or an Intel machine,
and will attempt to make use of 64-bit on supported Intel processors.
It comes packaged as a standard Installer package.

*Warning*: A certificate file to attach to projects that use HTTPS,
like World Community Grid,
was accidentally left out from 0.1.1.
This will be fixed in 0.1.2.

There is currently no uninstaller.
This will be addressed in a future version.

=== Linux ===
Making a portable Linux binary is hard,
so we only provide source code for Linux.
A Debian package may be available for the next version.
Other distros will be supported if someone volunteers to make a package.

Unlike BOINC, the Synecdoche client will always use the same directory to store its data,
instead of the current working directory.
This eliminates common confusion when people run the client from a different place than the previous time
and notice "they lost their running tasks".

== Limitations ==

Synecdoche cannot be running at the same time as BOINC.
This is not a bug; it would be the same as running two instances of BOINC at the same time.

Some projects may not work correctly.
We try to remain compatible with BOINC,
but sometimes projects rely on more implementation details than they should.
A [ProjectCompatibilityMatrix project compatibility list] is kept to document incompatibilities.
Currently the only project known to have problems is POEM@Home.

The manager is only available in English,
translations are currently disabled.
We plan to bring translations back,
but it needs some work,
especially in the build system
and in how we will work with volunteer translations.
