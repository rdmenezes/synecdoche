#summary Release notes for Synecdoche version 0.1.1

= Introduction =

The release notes for Synecdoche document differences from BOINC,
and things you will want to watch out for when running Synecdoche.

= Notes for 0.1.1 =

Synecdoche is based on BOINC 6.2.
This means there is no support for running CUDA applications,
since it was added in BOINC 6.4.
We have no plans to implement CUDA support in the near future.

== Differences from BOINC ==
 * Some UI updates

== Installation instructions ==

=== Windows ===
There is no real installer yet.
Synecdoche is available as a zip archive
containing the needed programs.

To use it, extract the archive into its own folder
and run "synecmgr.exe".

Due to the lack of a real installer,
it will not auto-start on boot.

=== Mac OS X ===
Synecdoche requires Mac OS X 10.4 or later.
It will run on a PowerPC machine or an Intel machine,
and will attempt to make use of 64-bit on supported Intel processors.
It comes packaged as a standard Installer package.
Run the package, and it will install Synecdoche in the Applications folder for you.
Currently, the install location cannot be changed.
By default, it also installs the Synecdoche screensaver
and a project list to be used by the GUI.

To start, open Synecdoche.app in the Applications folder.

To make it run on boot, add Synecdoche.app to your
Login Items in System Preferences.

Note that if you run as a non-admin user,
even if you enter the admin password while installing,
you may not be able to run Synecdoche later.
This issue is being investigated.

There is currently no uninstaller.
Dragging the application to the Trash is not enough;
the project data and the screensaver will remain in the system.
This will be addressed in a future version.

== Limitations ==

Synecdoche cannot be running at the same time as BOINC.
This is not a bug; it would be the same as running two instances of BOINC at the same time.

Some projects may not work correctly.
We try to remain compatible with BOINC,
but sometimes projects rely on more implementation details than they should.
A [ProjectCompatibilityMatrix project compatibility list] is kept to document incompatibilities.
Currently the only project known to have problems is POEM@Home.

The manager is only available in English,
translations are currently disabled.
We plan to bring translations back,
but it needs some work,
especially in the build system
and in how we will work with volunteer translations.
