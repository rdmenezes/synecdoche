#summary The future of Synecdoche

= First Release =

In order to get the first release available quickly, Synecdoche will not diverge far from BOINC. Tasks for the first milestone are:
 * Replacing the BOINC branding, and correcting situations where the BOINC branding is hardcoded.
 * Fixing known bugs.
 * Incremental performance improvements for the GUI.
 * Opportunistic usability improvements. Usability will be addressed properly in the second release.

= Second Release =
 * Installation docs
 * Release note template (what to do, and where)
 * Complete installers/uninstallers for all platforms
   * Single package application (OS X only?)
   * Did we decide on WiX for Windows?

= Third Release =
 * Consistent error notification
 * Improved CLI
 * Flexible columns (allow user to change what columns to show)
   * More information allowed in the manager (project DCF comes to mind)

= Tasks not yet assigned to a milestone =

 * Multi-threaded communications.
 * New theme engine for simple view.
 * Multi-computer view.
 * Standard XML library.
 * Fix Unicode for user names, team names, etc.

 * Short term
   * New GUI RPC protocol
   * Improved message reporting (message hierarchy, templated messages)
 * One day
   * GPU support (CUDA, Stream, OpenCL)
   * Goal-based CPU scheduler

== Ongoing tasks ==
 * Code cleanup and documentation.
 * Unit testing (requires refactoring)
