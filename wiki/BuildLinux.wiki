#summary Instructions to compile from source on Unix-like systems

= Building the client on Linux =

You will need:
 * A reasonably modern C++ compiler
 * GNU make 3.79+ (although Sun make appears to work too)
 * libcurl 7.17.1+ (with HTTPS support, for some projects)
 * OpenSSL
 * zlib

Additionally, to compile the GUI
you need wxWidgets 2.6;
but preferably 2.8.

To compile, run the usual commands:
 * `./configure --prefix=PREFIX`
 * `make`
 * `make install`

Replace `PREFIX` with the directory where you want to install Synecdoche.
The client will use `PREFIX`/var/synecdoche as data directory by default.

If you get the code from SVN,
or if you want to modify the buildsystem,
you will also need:
 * autoconf 2.58+
 * automake 1.8+
 * libtool 1.4+

and run autoreconf -i to create the configure script.
