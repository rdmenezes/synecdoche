#summary This page provides a matrix showing which client works with which project.

The idea behind this page is to provide information for the case when changes at BOINC or synecdoche break the compatibility between (certain versions of) the synecdoche client and certain BOINC based projects.

  # The POEM@home application modifies its input files when writing a checkpoint. From r725 on synecdoche checks if all input files are OK before starting the corresponding science application. The result is that the POEM input files are invalid from the client's perspective when restarting the POEM application after it wrote at least one checkpoint. As a safety measure the client aborts this workunit in this case. (Note: It can't re-download the file as this would destroy the state of the workunit.) This problem was [http://boinc.fzk.de/poem/forum_thread.php?id=322 reported to POEM@Home admins] (German).
