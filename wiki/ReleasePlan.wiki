#summary Planned schedule for releases
= Release Plan =

_"Release early, release often."_ Because we have inherited a mature code-base from BOINC, we are able to timetable the first release very early.

The following is extremely tentative:

 * Release alpha builds on a fortnightly cycle.
 * Set milestone dates based on a 6 month public release cycle.
 * Start the development cycle for milestone 1 at the feature inclusion stage. Milestone 1 should be feature complete within weeks.
