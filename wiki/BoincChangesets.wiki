#summary Tracking BOINC revisions

== Rejected changes ==

Changesets that are irrelevant to Synecdoche are not shown. Some decisions listed here make subsequent changesets irrelevant.

|| *Changeset* || *Reason* ||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15537 15537]||Properties. This feature is nowhere near ready.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15559 15559]||Message filtering. This is not a good UI for filtering.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15561 15561]||Already fixed.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15568 15568]||Concatenated strings.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15573 15573]||Solaris. This addition appears to be in the wrong file.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15574 15574]||Already fixed. Correctly!||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15764 15764]||API`*` ||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15585 15585]||Undocumented. This will be moot when we use wxTaskBarIcon.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15587 15587]||Event ids. This is pointless. See r75.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15588 15588]||Solved better in r76. Ours won't cycle the logs if an error is logged when parsing the config file.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15591 15591]||CUDA. We don't support this yet.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15610 15610]||Reboot. This is just wrong.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15690 15690]||Already fixed.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15693 15693]||API`*` ||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15694 15694]||API`*` ||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15793 15793]||Already fixed in r171.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15801 15801]||Already fixed in r152. Correctly!||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15808 15808]||Already fixed in r194.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15850 15850]||Proposed async solution is not typesafe. Grid view was already fixed (removed).||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15891 15891]||Useless and already fixed correctly||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15920 15920]||Already fixed in r265.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15942 15942]||Already fixed in r265.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15944 15944]||Already fixed in r236.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15948 15948]||Already fixed in r298.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16029 16029]||WCG "feature" for the wizards. No need for that.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16061 16061]||Exclude list for proxy. Useful feature but bad implementation.`*` Additional changesets: 16066||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16087 16087]||"exclusive app" feature.`*` Additional changesets: 16084/16085/16090/16175/16354||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16095 16095]||RPC calls are not obsolete just because the official manager does not use them any more.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16118 16118]||Sample wrapper, useless Makefile fix, debug code already removed in r254||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16119 16119]||Already fixed.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16130 16130]||Documentation fixes for doxygen||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16188 16188]||Report job resources even when no active task. Coproc feature.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16268 16268]||Already fixed in r449.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16357 16357]||There is no need for this mess (except the change for rr_sim.cpp).||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16358 16358]||Already fixed in r72.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16387 16387]||client: there were a few places where we had 1e9 instead of 1 gig (2^20^) - Actually 1e9 would be correct when talking about Gigabytes instead of Gibibytes (which would be 2^30^ anyway...)||

`*` These changesets may still be needed.
