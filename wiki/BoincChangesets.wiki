== Pending merge ==

|| *Changesets* || *Additional comments* ||

||15865||||
||15929||Precompiled headers work for the manager, but do they work for the client/lib/etc (windows only)?||
||15945||Do we need the screensaver stuff? The other fix is already applied.||
||15955/15957/15958/15960/15961/15963/15965||Code signing stuff.||
||15959/15964/15966||MGR: Save and restore selected items by key values when refreshing||
||15987||MGR: Simple GUI fixes||
||16003||Is this used by the client or does this belong to the server?||
||16121||MGR: show resource requirements of all jobs, running or not||
||16206/16207||client: clarify and fix the semantics of "next RPC time".||
||16208||client: new config flags||
||16212||MGR: Fix updating task bar icon on disconnect from Client, fix a crash on exiting||
||16242||MGR: fix disk display when talking to pre-6.3 client - do we need this fix?||
||16247||MGR: More thorough validity checking to prevent crashes||
||16280||MGR: Add a new tab status to the Simple GUI for when the client has been instructed to delay starting applications via the <delay_start> option in cc_config.xml (From Kevin Reed)||
||16327||MGR: If simple_gui_only flag is set in cc_config.xml, trigger call of CSimpleFrame::OnConnect()||
||16336/16337/16347||MGR: When removing a row from sorted lists, refresh all rows to ensure proper display update (Does anyone know which bug is fixed by this changeset? Do we need it?)||
||16338/16339/16340/16344/16348/16357||client: move round-robin simulation to its own file||
||16352||MGR: Always sort after a row is added or deleted.||
||16355/16400||client: the preemptability order was wrong||
||16356||client: cleaned up CPU scheduler logic somewhat||
||16366/16383/16386/16391||client: revise round-robin simulation to take variable avg_ncpus into account (I'm not sure if we need this or if this change works with our ncpu-fix.)||
||16377/16378/16379/16381||MGR: Move the wxWidget version information to the about box.||
||16395/16396||client: fix bug that caused occasional assert in pop_heap() for the preemptable_task_list.||

||16432/16433||client: make host CPID a function of: MAC addresses + hostname + IP addr + OS name||
||16479||API: free project prefs before parsing init file||
||16484||MGR: Erase and refresh entire Tasks panel when selecting a new tab to try to fix cosmetic bug reported by David on Windows - Which bug? Is it caused by the RPC thread?||
||16488||SVCCTRL: Introduce a new binary that is used to start and stop the BOINC service, if it is installed as a service. - Looks like this is only needed for service install on Vista. Do we support/need this?||

||16545||client: in round-robin simulation, only increment CPU shortfall (per-project or overall) if there are no pending tasks.||

||16900/16903/16905||Adds platform information to the project list used when attaching to a new project. We should check if it makes sense to apply this directly or whether we should write an own implementation.||
||16929||client: fix boinc_copy (again); Mac Mgr: fix bugs showing Mgr when minimized to Dock;||



== Rejected changes ==

Changesets that are irrelevant to Synecdoche are not shown. Some decisions listed here make subsequent changesets irrelevant.

|| *Changeset* || *Reason* ||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15537 15537]||Properties. This feature is nowhere near ready.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15559 15559]||Message filtering. This is not a good UI for filtering.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15561 15561]||Already fixed.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15568 15568]||Concatenated strings.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15573 15573]||Solaris. This addition appears to be in the wrong file.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15574 15574]||Already fixed. Correctly!||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15764 15764] `*`||API||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15585 15585]||Undocumented. This will be moot when we use wxTaskBarIcon.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15587 15587]||Event ids. This is pointless. See r75.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15588 15588]||Solved better in r76. Ours won't cycle the logs if an error is logged when parsing the config file.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15591 15591]||CUDA. We don't support this yet.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15610 15610]||Reboot. This is just wrong.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15690 15690]||Already fixed.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15693 15693] `*`||API||

||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15850 15850]||Proposed async solution is not typesafe. Grid view was already fixed (removed).||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15891 15891]||Useless and already fixed correctly||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15920 15920]||Already fixed in r265.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15942 15942]||Already fixed in r265.||

||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/15970 15970]||Flickering of the MGR - Some additional changesets: 15978/15981/15990/15991/15993/15994/15995/15996/15998/16006/16185||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16029 16029]||WCG "feature" for the wizards. No need for that.||

||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16061 16061] `*`||Exclude list for proxy. Useful feature but bad implementation. Additional changesets: 16066||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16087 16087] `*`||"exclusive app" feature. Additional changesets: 16084/16085/16090/16175/16354/16552||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16095 16095]||RPC calls are not obsolete just because the official manager does not use them any more.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16118 16118]||Sample wrapper, useless Makefile fix, debug code already removed in r254||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16119 16119]||Already fixed.||

||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16357 16357]||There is no need for this mess (except the change for rr_sim.cpp).||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16358 16358]||Already fixed in r72.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16560 16560]||No need for this new page and account key page already removed in r526.||
||[http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/changeset/16754 16754]||Another useless hack: "new work fetch logic". Additional changesets: 16755/16756/16765||

`*` These changesets may still be needed.
