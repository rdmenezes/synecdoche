Synecdoche doesn't currently have an installer. To "install" it, just extract
this .zip archive into a directory of your choice, and double click on
"synecmgr.exe" to run it.

Project files will be saved in the same folder.

Don't extract into the "Program files" folder; that will cause problems on
Windows Vista.

To start it more easily, you may want to create a shortcut to synecmgr.exe.
If you do, make sure "Start in:" in the shortcut properties is set to the folder
where Synecdoche is.

To launch Synecdoche when the computer starts, create such a shortcut and put it
in "Start menu\Programs\Startup", and add /s at the end of the "Target" text box
(after synecmgr.exe). This will keep Synecdoche manager from showing a window
automatically; only the tray icon will appear.
