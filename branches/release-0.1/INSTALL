Quick start
===========

As in most packages available nowadays, compiling and installing Synecdoche is
done by running the usual 'configure' and 'make' commands:

$ ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
$ make
$ make install

Replace PREFIX with the filesystem path where Synecdoche should be installed.
The default is /usr/local, in which case you will have to run 'make install' as
root.

Requirements
============

To build Synecdoche on a Unix platform, you need a relatively modern C++
compiler, and the following libraries:

 * libcurl 7.17.1 or later (HTTPS support may be required for some projects)
 * OpenSSL 0.9.8 or later
 * wxWidgets 2.6 or later, for the graphical manager (optional)

If you got Synecdoche from SVN (as opposed to a release tarball), or if for
some other reason your package lacks the 'configure' script, you will need to
run the following command before configure:

$ ./_autosetup

This requires autoconf 2.58+ and automake 1.08+ installed.
