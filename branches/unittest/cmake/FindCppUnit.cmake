# Find the CppUnit includes and library
#
# This module defines
# CPPUNIT_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the cppunit include directory
# (actual files would be in eg. ${CPPUNIT_INCLUDE_DIR}/cppunit/TestAssert.h)
# CPPUNIT_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against to use CppUnit.
# CPPUNIT_FOUND, If false, do not try to use CppUnit.

# also defined, but not for general use are
# CPPUNIT_LIBRARY, where to find the CppUnit library.
# CPPUNIT_DEBUG_LIBRARY, where to find the CppUnit library in debug
# mode.
